## Project Overview

This Order Handling System provides a simple yet powerful solution for businesses to track orders from creation to completion. The application offers a clean user interface for managing order data and maintains a detailed audit trail of all system activities.

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture

The application follows a traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM models for Orders and Logs
- **Views**: Jinja2 HTML templates with Bootstrap styling
- **Controllers**: Flask routes handling business logic

### Database Design

Two primary database tables form the foundation of the system:

1. **Orders Table**:
   - `id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier
   - `items`: Number of items in the order
   - `delivery_date`: Expected delivery date
   - `sender_name`: Name of the sender
   - `recipient_name`: Name of the recipient
   - `recipient_address`: Delivery address
   - `status`: Current order status (Ongoing/Completed)

2. **Logs Table**:
   - `id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier
   - `type`: Type of action performed
   - `performer`: Name of the person who performed the action
   - `timestamp`: Date and time when the action was performed

### Key Design Decisions

1. **SQLite Database**: Chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment without requiring a separate database server.

2. **Action Logging**: Every system action is logged with user attribution to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.

3. **Modal Confirmations**: Important actions require confirmation through modal dialogs to prevent accidental operations.

4. **User Attribution**: Without a formal authentication system, the application requests the performer's name for each action to maintain accountability.

5. **Status Tracking**: Orders can be tracked as "Ongoing" or "Completed" with clear visual indicators.

6. **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation ensure data integrity.

## Features

### Order Management

- **Create Orders**: Add new orders with complete details
  - Option to mark orders as completed upon creation
  - Duplicate detection to prevent accidental duplicate entries
  
- **View Orders**: See all orders in a clean tabular format
  - Visual indicators for order status (Ongoing/Completed)
  
- **Edit Orders**: Update any order details as needed
  - All changes are tracked in the log system
  
- **Delete Orders**: Remove orders that are no longer needed
  - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
  
- **Complete Orders**: Mark orders as delivered/completed
  - Orders can be marked complete either during creation or later

### Activity Logging

- All system activities are automatically logged with:
  - Action type (Create/Update/Delete/Complete)
  - User who performed the action
  - Timestamp of when the action occurred
  
- Logs can be viewed in chronological order (newest first)
  - Provides accountability and audit capabilities

## About the Logging System

The current implementation requires users to input their name when performing actions because there is no role-based authentication system in place. This approach was chosen for simplicity while still maintaining accountability for all system activities.

In a production environment with multiple users, implementing proper authentication would be recommended. This would allow:
- Automatic capture of user information for logging
- Different permission levels for different user roles
- Enhanced security for sensitive operations
